Status of work:
- Currently I am working on code and process documentation for this emulator written in python.
- Working on adding additional features that were not present in the original NES
  
- [Here](https://github.com/dwipddalal/C-emulator), I am working on writing the same code in C++ for faster performance.

The NES game used on this Emulator is Super Mario taken from [this](https://www.nesfiles.com/NES/Super_Mario_Bros/) website

### Emulation Process

- Upon initializing, the emulator loads a ROM file, which is the game to be played. It sets up the emulated environment, including CPU, PPU, and memory.
- It enters a main loop, akin to the NES's own operational cycle. In this loop, it executes CPU instructions, updates the PPU for graphics, and handles input from the controllers.
- The emulator manages interrupts, crucial for timing and synchronization in games, through the `Interrupter` class.
- It simulates the original NES display on a modern screen, including options for scaling the display to suit different resolutions.

### Save States and User Interaction

- Unique to emulators is the ability to save and load the exact state of the game at any point, a feature not available on the original NES hardware. This is handled through Python's `pickle` module.
- The emulator also incorporates additional user interaction features like a heads-up display (HUD) toggle and real-time performance metrics (like FPS).

**INSTRUCTION_SET Dictionary**:
   - This is a comprehensive dictionary mapping instruction mnemonics (like "ADC", "AND", "ASL", etc.) to their corresponding `InstructionSet`. Each `InstructionSet` contains:
     - The name of the instruction.
     - A dictionary of `AddressModes` to `Instruction` objects, detailing how the instruction behaves with different addressing modes, including the opcode (bytecode), the size of the instruction in bytes, and the number of CPU cycles it takes to execute.
